# Version 1.00 
Version 1.00 of the application introduces several key functionalities for task scheduling:

1 - Select Task from Non-Scheduled Tasks:
Users can now choose tasks from the list of non-scheduled tasks for scheduling.
Multiple tasks can be scheduled for the same date, hour, and minute range.

2 - Display Scheduled Tasks:
Scheduled tasks are visually represented in the corresponding hour and minute slots on the scheduling plan.
This provides users with a clear overview of the tasks scheduled for specific time intervals.

3 - Unschedule Task:
Users have the ability to unschedule tasks, allowing them to easily return a task to the list of non-scheduled tasks.

4 - JSP Functionality with JavaScript:
The scheduling functionality is enhanced by incorporating JavaScript.
Task scheduling is initiated automatically upon task selection without the need for a separate confirmation button.

5 - Single-Page Application:
All functionalities and features are integrated into a single-page application.
Users can perform task scheduling, view scheduled tasks, and unschedule tasks seamlessly within the same page.

Overall, version 1.00 streamlines the task scheduling process, enhances user interaction with dynamic updates, and consolidates all application features into a cohesive and user-friendly single-page interface.
